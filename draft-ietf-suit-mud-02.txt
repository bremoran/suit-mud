          Strong Assertions of IoT Network Access Requirements
                         draft-ietf-suit-mud-02

Abstract

   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification describes the
   access and network functionality required a device to properly
   function.  The MUD description has to reflect the software running on
   the device and its configuration.  Because of this, the most
   appropriate entity for describing device network access requirements
   is the same as the entity developing the software and its
   configuration.

   A network presented with a MUD file by a device allows detection of
   misbehavior by the device software and configuration of access
   control.

   This document defines a way to link a SUIT manifest to a MUD file
   offering a stronger binding between the two.

1.  Introduction

   Under [RFC8520], devices report a URL to a MUD manager in the
   network.  RFC 8520 envisions different approaches for conveying the
   information from the device to the network such as:

   *  DHCP,

   *  IEEE802.1AB Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and

   *  IEEE 802.1X whereby the URL to the MUD file would be contained in
      the certificate used in an EAP method.

   The MUD manager then uses the the URL to fetch the MUD file, which
   contains access and network functionality required a device to
   properly function.

   The MUD manager must trust the service from which the URL is fetched
   and to return an authentic copy of the MUD file.  This concern may be
   mitigated using the optional signature reference in the MUD file.
   The MUD manager must also trust the device to report a correct URL.
   In case of DHCP and LLDP the URL is unprotected.  When the URL to the
   MUD file is included in a certificate then it is authenticated and
   integrity protected.  A certificate created for use with network
   access authentication is typically not signed by the entity that
   wrote the software and configured the device, which leads to
   conflation of local network access rights with rights to assert all
   network access requirements.

   There is a need to bind the entity that creates the software and
   configuration to the MUD file because only that entity can attest the
   network access requirements of the device.  This specification
   defines an extension to the SUIT manifest to include a MUD file (per
   reference or by value).  When combining a manufacturer usage
   description with a manifest used for software/firmware updates
   (potentially augmented with attestation) then a network operator can
   get more confidence in the description of the access and network
   functionality required a device to properly function.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Architecture

   The intended workflow is as follows:

   *  At the time of onboarding, devices report their manifest in use to
      the MUD manager.

   *  If the SUIT_MUD_container has been severed, the suit-reference-uri
      can be used to retrieve the complete manifest.

   *  The manifest authenticity is verified by the MUD manager, which
      enforces that the MUD file presented is also authentic and as
      intended by the device software vendor.

   *  Each time a device is updated, rebooted, or otherwise
      substantially changed, it will execute an attestation.

      -  Among other claims in the Entity Attestation Token (EAT)
         [I-D.ietf-rats-eat], the device will report its software
         digest(s), configuration digest(s), primary manifest URI, and
         primary manifest digest to the MUD manager.

      -  The MUD manager can then validate these attestation reports in
         order to check that the device is operating with the expected
         version of software and configuration.

      -  Since the manifest digest is reported, the MUD manager can look
         up the corresponding manifest.

   *  If the MUD manager does not already have a full copy of the
      manifest, it can be acquired using the reference URI.

   *  Once a full copy of the manifest is provided, the MUD manager can
      verify the device attestation report and apply any appropriate
      policy as described by the MUD file.

4.  Extensions to SUIT

   To enable strong assertions about the network access requirements
   that a device should have for a particular software/configuration
   pair, we include the ability to add MUD files to the SUIT manifest.
   However, there are also circumstances in which a device should allow
   the MUD to be changed without a firmware update.  To enable this, we
   add a MUD url to SUIT along with a subject-key identifier, according
   to [RFC7093], mechanism 4 (the keyIdentifier is composed of the hash
   of the DER encoding of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo value).

   The following CDDL describes the extension to the SUIT_Manifest
   structure:

   ? suit-manifest-mud => SUIT_Digest

   The SUIT_Envelope is also amended:

   ? suit-manifest-mud => bstr .cbor SUIT_MUD_container

   SUIT_MUD_container = {
       ? suit-mud-url => #6.32(tstr),
       ? suit-mud-ski => SUIT_Digest,
       ? suit-mud-file => bstr
   }

   The MUD file is included verbatim within the bstr.  No limits are
   placed on the MUD file: it may be any RFC8520-compliant file.

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification links MUD files to other IETF technologies,
   particularly to SUIT manifests, for improving security protection and
   ease of use.  By including MUD files (per reference or by value) in
   SUIT manifests an extra layer of protection has been created and
   synchronization risks can be minimized.  If the MUD file and the
   software/firmware loaded onto the device gets out-of-sync a device
   may be firewalled and, with firewalling by networks in place, the
   device may stop functioning.

6.  IANA Considerations

   suit-manifest-mud must be added as an extension point to the SUIT
   manifest registry.
